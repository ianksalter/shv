An initial spacial design has been outlined to meet the requirements directly
in blender [../blender/SHV-01.blend](../blender/SHV-01.blend). An stl version
of this design is available here [../blender/SHV-01.stl](../blender/SHV-01.stl).


The following tasks are outstanding with regards to spatial design.

- Understand the impact of insulation on the space for the spatial design.
- Determine ceiling heights based upon heating and heat transmission
calculations.
- Capture the design (and possibly design options) as data rather than rely on
a single blender file. This is so that 2d representations can be generated.
