Ideally all systems should integrate as part of open protocol smart home
systems.

## Water Heating

Here we need to select from amongst water heating options probably selecting
some form of heat pump option. It might be worth considering fault tolerant
water heating options but this may be overkill.

## Space Heating and Cooling

We need to heat the place in the midst of winter and cool the place at the hight of summer.

Here we need to look at mini split system options as well as considering underfloor heating.

## Ventilation

Need to specify a ventilation system that provides fresh air. This system, If
fitted, should use heat exchanger technology and be able to manage humidity.
Should look at passive house components for this.

## Kitchen

Here we are considering two options. A normal domestic kitchen perhaps supplied
by IKEA. The alternative is a stainless steel kitchen custom produced by
a Valencian manufacturer. Some combination of both approaches shouldn't be ruled out.

Here we are looking to source simple components probably from Leroy Merlin,
Bauhaus or Ikea.
These are

* Shower
* Wash Basin
* Toilet with Bidet Shower

The bathroom should function as a wet room.


## Security Systems

Here we need to research systems to detect fire and maybe carbon monoxide 
and maybe perhaps also unauthorised entry.
