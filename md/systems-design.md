Ideally all systems should integrate as part of open protocol smart home
systems.

## Water Heating

Here we need to select from amongst water heating options probably selecting
some form of heat pump option. It might be worth considering fault tolerant
water heating options but this may be overkill.


If underfloor heating is installed - would it be advisable to have two cylinders
one for hot water and one for underploor heating.

Need to think about weight of tanks on the bathroom wall.

## Space Heating and Cooling

We need to heat the place in the midst of winter and cool the place at the hight of summer.

Here we need to look at mini split system options as well as considering underfloor heating.

Minisplits need to run refegrient and also drainage. Need to think about drainage

from both the external and internal units.

Maybe able to drain into other drainage systems - but would have to put atrap on to avoid smells


Underfloor heating option €100 - €150 per sq meter - 


THis is long pipes set into floor. with topology.

See this article about underfloor cooling with ALTHERMA system from Daikin:
https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/archive/underfloor-heating-and-cooling-2


See the following brochure about altherma air to water heat pump systems from Daikin - note they also do ventilation systems
and have software tools for whole system design.

## Ventilation

Need to specify a ventilation system that provides fresh air. This system, If
fitted, should use heat exchanger technology and be able to manage humidity.
Should look at passive house components for this.


One company is https://www.siberzone.es/tienda/

Units include ventilation heat exchanger and humidity control.

## Kitchen

May go for a new kitchen design because of the pipework.

Here we are considering two options. A normal domestic kitchen perhaps supplied
by IKEA. The alternative is a stainless steel kitchen custom produced by
a Valencian manufacturer. Some combination of both approaches shouldn't be ruled out.

Here we are looking to source simple components probably from Leroy Merlin,
Bauhaus or Ikea.
These are


Shower trap well be key for drainage:

See for example:

https://www.bauhaus.es/canales-de-ducha/camargue-desaguee-de-ducha/p/20730934

* Shower
* Wash Basin        
* Toilet with Bidet Shower

This avoids having to have a trap on the shower:

Would site in the bathroom probably


The bathroom should function as a wet room. That means we need a wet room membrane walls and floors.
On top of the screed under the tiles or ontop of the plasterboard/ plaster under  wall tiles.

## Security Systems

Here we need to research systems to detect fire and maybe carbon monoxide 
and maybe perhaps also unauthorised entry.
