## Walls

Here we need to choose materials and building approach for the walls of the
building that will create spaces for 2 bedrooms a corridor and two bathrooms.

We need to consider choice for wall materials as well as building approach:

Choices might include:

- Brick build walls

- Traditional wooden stud partitions

- Track and Stud Approach

## Doors and Windows

Can cut out the space for windows and reuse the old bricks as hardcore.

Probably have to pour the lintels. So that's shuttering and rebar. 

Need to get enough bricks below to get the bottom bit of the shuttering.

Front windows and doors will just be built into the block work.

West side lintle will be cut into existing bricks. The wall cut away after wards to make room for the windiow.

Can mix concrete for lintles by had. Rebar must be in the middle of the shuttering.

First layer in lintle is thicker and tamped down to get air out. The rebar then
another layer. Two pieces of rebar side by side.


May need to consider supporting the walls above windows with acros and wood
or strong boys (tm) supports.. Strong boys only need the acros on one side.


May be able to get front door and window above created as a single unit.


Here we need to consider the following:

- Window / Door type - for various windows including the thermal properties

- Window/   Door suppliers

- Window / Door sizes and locations from spatial design

## Ceilings, Attic and Crawl Space


Here we need to consider:

- The structure of the attic and crawl spaces so that they can support the load
of a human working as well as any located systems or any items being stored.

Currently we are considering the option of wooden beams mounted on joist
hangers running from east to west across the building. There are effectively
two spans:

4.9 and 6.1 meters.

Sources for calculations (will need Spanish equivalent for this):

https://www.timberbeamcalculator.co.uk/en-gb/span-table/floor-joists?class=C24&slope=0&load=1.5

4.9 meters
C24 ALS/ CLS needs 89 * 235mm @ 450mm meter intervals with load of not more than 0.5 kN/m2

6.1 meters
C24 ALS/ CLS needs 89 * 235mm @ 400 meter intervals with load of not more than 0.2.5 kN/m2




- Need to consider access points to the attic and types of ladders to be used:

Some loft ladder options are:

## Heat and Sound Insulation

Here we need to consider the insulation to be used for the walls, floor and
ceiling together with any membrane technology to meet passive house or other
certifications.


Note on he ceiling we could mix sound and heat insulation. We could also try
the same approach on the walls - e'g thermal, rubber (for one frequency)
then ply for another frequency. Perhaps treat the living room diferently from the corridor.

Floor: Passive house component:

Need to look at options. This might include:

Polyisocyanurate which comes in multiple sizes which may help solve our floor levelling problem.
