# Background

The owner is converting 80 m2 of shop space with a 30 m2 terrace to a 2 bedroomed apartment. It is aimed to achieve a high amount of sustainability in terms of construction methods and materials. The finished apartment should also be highly sustainable, ideally meeting passive house standards and achieving the highest score on the energy performance certificate.

\newpage

# Spatial Design

The goal is to create the following spaces:

-   Living Space - This should include a fixed kitchen area, comfortable seating areas, an office work area and a music work area.
-   Bathroom - A simple functional bathroom which is easy to clean and maintain with silent systems.
-   Bedrooms (2) - Configurable bedroom spaces that should have room for a large double bed, chest of draws, wardrobe and desk.
-   Corridor - A connecting space in which 5 bicycles will be kept but that should still have enough space for easy manoeuvrability.
-   Attic Space - An attic space should be created for storage and as a place to site systems such as water heating and ventilation.
-   Crawl Space - Where the apartment ceilings are high a crawl space should be constructed so that ventilation ducts and other services can be easily maintained.
-   Terrace - A configurable outdoor space that can be used for eating, sitting comfortably, bike maintenance and occasional light work with materials.

The spatial design is constrained by the sustainability goals of the project. In particular, the desire to meet the passive house standard.

The spacial design should deliver:

-   A 2 dimensional vector graphics diagrams for plan and elevation views.
-   A three dimensional blender model of the finished apartment.
-   Measurements for all the features required to create the spatial design. So for example it would list the size and location of the windows, the location of plumbing outlets and inlets, etc.

# Foundations

The following aspects are considered part of the foundational work of the project:

-   Repairs to Structural Pillars
-   Drainage
-   Damp Proofing
-   Floor Levelling
-   Plumbing
-   Electricial

## Repairs to Structural Pillars

Some of the pillars have exposed rebar and need repairing. This may or may not be done by the building as a whole.

## Drainage

There is existing drainage for shower toilet and sink but these will have to be moved. Drainage will need to be created for the washing machine, dishwasher and kitchen sink. There is also to a need to introduce improved drainage for the terrace. Deformed concrete in the floor indicates that there may be a problem with the existing drainage.

## Damp Proofing

The building is of reinforced concrete construction. Given what I have seen from other building sites in the area I believe that the building is sited on sand or very sandy soil. There seems to be rising damp from this soil. Salt appears to be crystallising on the wall. This may not be surprising given that the property is just a little over a kilometre from the beach. A damp course should be installed and other measures (such as a damp proof membrane on the floor) taken to deal with this problem.

## Floor Levelling

The floor at the front of the building is about 20cm higher than the floor at the rear (see diagram). The goal is to have level floors throughout including the terrace.

## Plumbing

Plumbing needs to be installed in the following locations:

- Kitchen - for kitchen sink, dishwasher and washing machine.
- Bathroom - for shower, bathroom sink, toilet and bidet shower.
- Terrace - for single stand alone cold tap.

\newpage

## Electrical

The following lighting locations are required

- Single Central Ceiling Light - bedroom 1, bedroom 2, bathroom, equipment attic
(above bathroom) andcrawl space.
- Pair of Ceiling Lights - corridor, storage attic (above bedrooms)
- More sophisticated lighting (to be designed) - kitchen / living area, terrace.

As far as sockets go the following are the requirements:

- Bathroom should contain sockets for toothbrush and hairdryer.
- Bedrooms should contain 4 evenly spread sockets
- Corridor - 2 sockets
- Terrace - 2 sockets (one east one west) + support.
- Equipment Attic - sockets to support water heater and ventilation system.
- Main attic - 4  evenly spread sockets
- Kitchen Area - Ample sockets for worktops including Island. Cooker socket for
Island. Wall sockets for robot cleaners.
- Living area - two sockets on each major wall.

Electrical support will also required for any mini-split systems, heatpumps and
 possibly also underfloor heating.

\newpage

# Structures

The following are considered the structural aspects of the design:

-   Walls
-   Doors and Windows
-   Ceilings, Attic and Crawl Space
-   Heat and Sound Insulation

## Walls

We need to create space for two bedrooms and a bathroom.

## Doors and Windows

Doors and windows need to be installed at front and rear of the building and also the light well. At a guess this will be a total of 4 windows, two sets of french windows and one secure front door.

## Ceilings, Attic and Crawl Space

The Space has 4.3 meters of height. I would like to lower the ceiling to make the space easier to heat and cool. The false ceiling should be insulated and strong enough for storage and maintenance. There should be ladders leading up to each of the the attic space.

## Heat and Sound Insulation

The goal is to optimise heat insulation to meet Passive House standards and qualifies for an Energy Performance certificate at level A. Sound insulation should enable the owner to work on music projects using studio monitors without annoying the neighbours. Likewise sound insulation should cut out noise from outside and neighbouring properties.

\newpage

# Systems

The following are considered system aspects of the home:

-   Water Heating
-   Space Heating and Cooling
-   Ventilation
-   Kitchen
-   Bathroom
-   Security Systems

The goal is to aim for system integration as part of a general smart home system.

## Water Heating

Ideally need to install an efficient hot water heating systems that is programmable with emerging smart home standards.

## Space Heating and Cooling

We need to heat the place in the midst of winter and cool the place at the hight of summer. Likely to go for some kind of mini split based system though underfloor heating may be an option too.

## Ventilation

In addition to the HVAC install I want to consider creating a separate ventilation system that provides fresh air. This system, if fitted, should use heat exchanger technology and be able to manage humidity.

## Kitchen

This may end up being an Ikea install though there is the possibility of a restaurant style stainless steel kitchen. Investigations of having the latter built locally are ongoing.

## Bathroom

The bathroom should contain the following simple, functional, maintainable and
quiet components:

* Shower
* Wash Basin
* Toilet with Bidet Shower

The bathroom should function as a wet room.

## Security Systems

A security system should be considered. At minimum this should detect fire and maybe carbon monoxide but perhaps also unauthorised entry.

\newpage

# Finishing

The property should be finished with simple materials. A simple coat of plaster could be sufficient. More sophisticated 


# Regulations and Certifications
