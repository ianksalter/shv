#   Repairs to Structural Pillars

Give anti oxides treatment and cover with foam. Check regs on what might happen with the foam.

Shutter and concrete.

Mix would be

Sharp sand (66%), & cement (33%) - probably no room for stones. 

#   Drainage

40 to 1 drop on the drainage.

4inch - 10cm pipe for wc and poss bathroom sink.

3inch 7.5 cm for shower and kitchen wastes. Shower and kitchen stuff to go into 3 inch. Maybe also
the bathroom sink with a trap - see bathroom design.

Arqueta is the name for manhole there are various but they are odd sizes. Examples are:

https://www.bauhaus.es/arquetas-canaletas-y-sumideros/dakota-arqueta-seventy/p/24758831

May be best to make a custom one from bricks and pipes - would still need to buy
manhole cover. Can get covers that take tiles e.g:

Need to check whether drainage requires inspection.

Can do French drain as  a channel. Use sharp sand. Round off the corners. Can do same time as wall building which save on cement mixer hire. Membrane can be glued together with contact adhesive and can also run into a ceramic pipe.

Make sure the pipers are supported pea shingle may be best. When its not in a trench
may need bricks either side to keep the pea shingle in place. Could use bricks at a pinch.


#   Damp Proofing

One option is permaguard (may need Spanish Equivalent) https://www.permagard.co.uk/damp-proof-membrane-kit-10m

Floors we would use normal damp course DPM Damp proof membrane and that goes up the wall so they overlap.

There would be damp courses for the walls - a DPC made from a different material.

See wikipedia page on Damp Proofing (and find Spanish Equivalents: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damp_proofing#:~:text=A%20damp%2Dproof%20course%20(DPC,phenomenon%20known%20as%20rising%20damp.&text=A%20common%20example%20is%20polyethylene,gaining%20moisture%20through%20capillary%20action.



# Bathoorm wall/ Entrance Wall and foundations

Foundations would be  be 40mm wide and 500 deep but need to check. Need DPC on the wall different from the one on a floor.

Concrete block/thermolite blocks for a wall Could use a wall starter - something you screw into the wall
and gives you the ties for the bricks. Generally stainless steel. Can use on pillar for
bathroom And against the wall for the entrance wall.

Building the wall on the bathroom can put in joist hangers as you go. Take care
with measurements - can also use engineering bricks to giver finer grain. Can 
also leave space for the joists as an alternative.


#   Floor Levelling floor insulation and underfloor heating pipes:

Process:

- level the floor
- DPM course
- PIR/ insulation
- underfloor heating (if done)
- screed

May need to contact contractors to lay outside concrete. Make sure shuttering is 
supporting properly as it can pour out. Stakes are not enough use blocks or stays.

Later in  the process put the screed inside. Take care that the concrete poouring process


One option is: https://www.caviti.es

A possible option is insulation.

#   Electricial


Any of the brick walls will need condultes chasing in with angle grinder.

Conduits for the kitchen island will need to be run through the screed. Probably
in the underfloor heating  structure/ mat bot not crossing the pipes.

Don't forget doorbell and electricity for systems - air con water & ventilation
